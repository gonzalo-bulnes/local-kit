[![Local Kit](http://b.repl.ca/v1/localkit-is%20awesome-ff00aa.png)](http://localkit.io)

Let's DRY together!

Every day we use software to validate personal ID numbers, make national payments online, get local financial indicators. Those pieces of code are almost always very specific to a geographic area, a local set of rules or cultural habits, or a particular legislation. Let's call them _locally-specific_
software. Quite easy when you know them, much more difficult and risky when you don't.

We believe in open-source and software freedom, we believe in collaboration and diversity and we decided to share the locally-specific software we write as a way to welcome our fellow developers when they start working near of us. Sounds cool? Join us! [Contibuting is easy](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/local-kit#contributing-is-easy).
